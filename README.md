# LeetCode Solutions & Daily Challenges

This repo contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems using `C++`, organized by **topic** and **daily challenges**.  
The goal is to track my progress, improve problem-solving skills, and share structured, readable solutions.
## Daily Challenges
You’ll find a folder dedicated to **daily problems** from LeetCode which is perfect for keeping consistency and developing a strong problem-solving habit.
## Topics Covered
| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Arrays** | Classic array manipulations, searching, and subarray problems |
| **Backtracking** | Explore recursion-based solutions and combinatorial generation |
| **Binary Search** | Efficient searching and optimization problems |
|️ **Bit Manipulation** | Smart use of bits for mathematical and logical problems |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Memoization and tabulation solutions for complex problems |
|️ **HashMap / Set** | Frequency counting, lookups, and pattern matching |
| **Heap / Priority Queue** | Top-k problems, merging, and scheduling |
| **Linked List** | Iterative and recursive list operations |
| **Prefix Sum** | Range sum and cumulative problems |
| **Queues** | BFS and order-based operations |
| **Recursion** | Divide-and-conquer and recursive tree/array algorithms |
| **Sliding Window** | Subarray/window-based optimization problems |
| **Sorting** | Classic sorting and custom comparator challenges |
| **Stacks** | Expression evaluation, next greater element, etc. |
| **Trees** | Traversals, recursion, and binary tree/graph problems |
| **Two Pointers** | Array/string problems using two-pointer technique |


-> Each directory includes its own `README.md` file containing links to the problems, explanations, and solutions for that specific topic.

## Purpose & Collaboration

This repository was created first and foremost for motivational reasons,  to build consistency, challenge daily, and track my growth over time. 

But beyond that, I believe it can also serve as a **helpful guide** for anyone looking to **grind LeetCode efficiently**, explore problem patterns, or simply find inspiration on where to start.

I’m always **open to collaboration**, feedback, or discussions about problem-solving strategies and algorithmic thinking.  
Whether you’re just starting out or deep into your DSA grind  **may your bugs be few, your logic be clear, and your runtime be faster than ever!**
